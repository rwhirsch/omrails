1.  This morning, she has new neurological findings that have unknown etiology.  Unclear if this is a stroke (unlikely) due to no focal findings vs. benzo withdrawl vs. reaction to anesthesia vs some other diagnosis.   Her daughter told me previously that she had had a reaction during her last cath by Dr. **NAME[XXX] which included transient neurological changes which resolved.  She was told it was probably a reaction to either the fentanyl or versed but not sure which one).  She was given general anesthesia yesterday.
2.  consult neurology

TTE **DATE[Oct 23 2012]: 
-normal EF of 65%, diastolic dysfunction
-Moderate mitral regurgitation as well as moderate to severe mitral stenosis. Pulmonary HTN with RVSP of 61.
TTE **DATE[Oct 31 2012]: 
1. Normal biventricular systolic function 
2. Mitral valve is rheumatic appearing. There is a likely torn chord prolapsing back into the LA with resultant severe mitral insufficiency (with pulmonary vein reversal). Gradient across the valve is in the severe range at a physiologic HR. 
3. Very small pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology 
4. Right pleural effusion and ascites noted 
5. Since previous echocardiogram report of **DATE[Oct 23 2012], MR appears more severe 
Plan: 
-continue with ASA, Plavix, Atenolol
-Lasix 60mg PO qday (home dose) 
-Have requested f/u with cardiology (Zhao)

<item><comm>Developed new "bright light" in her left eye after a mitra valve balloon valvuloplasty 3 days prior. Improved over an hour.  This event and her prior event are both consistent with ischemic events affecting the optic nerve.
 It is also possible that she suffers from ocular ischemic syndrome given her significant carotid stenosis OS, although she does not describe any pain and she does not have any heme/cotton wool spots/MAs that would indicate this pathology.  Her RAPD and mild pallor on exam today 2 days ago is
consistent with damage to the optic nerve.
         
Plan: 
- Managed cardiac risk factors
- Continued alphagan TID to lower IOP, encourage perfusion, and continue neuroprotection.  
- Avoided hypotension or anemia 
- patient to see home ophthalmology provider for refraction when discharged
- Pt may require a fluoresceine angiogram as an outpt to further establish diagnosis.
