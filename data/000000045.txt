1) Neuroendocrine tumor
--pt of **NAME[ZZZ]
--metastases to lungs and now brain
--being treated with Sorafenib twice a day.  Will continue this for now and defer further management to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ].
2) Brain Lesion
--seen by Brain MRI **DATE[Dec 2]; almost certainly metastasis associated with his known cancer and cause of his neurologic symptoms as his hallucinations have resolved completely with adding high dose steroids.  
--Rad Onc consulted; will see as outpatient on Monday to discuss brain radiation options
3) Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury
--has a single kidney s/p nephrectomy **DATE[Dec 2] gunshot wound
--baseline 1.5; >2 on admission, now downtrending
--complicated by mild hyperkalemia
--K and Cr improved with IVF
4) Hypertension
--Holding his home furosemide d/t volume depletion.  Holding proranolol d/t bradycardia while here.  Restarted his home clonidine .2mg TID at discharge, as he was progressively hypertensive since starting steroids
5) Liver Transplant
--immunosuppressive regimen: tacrolimus 1 mg bid
--tacro level 3 on admission; will continue current dosing and get q12h tacro levels to monitor;  per hepatology, level between 4-5 is sufficient given how far out from transplant the patient is
6) Insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus
--Increased home lantus from 10 to 25U qhs d/t steroids. Explained that he needs to tirate up by 2 U every 3-4 days until AM sugar <120.

Patient describes transient symptoms of darkening vision with headache, tinnitus, lightheadedness on standing, near-syncope with weakness/unsteadiness on feet, and hallucinations of people walking in right visual field.
Hypotension vs Hypoglycemia vs autonomic dysfunction vs seizure. Less likely to be intracranial structural defect as these episodes are transient, however need to r/o with MRI in this complicated pt. MRA as well, r/o carotid dissection given neck pain and tenderness on carotid palpation, potential impact on baroreceptor.
