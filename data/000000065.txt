- LGI bleed (ischemic colitis) considered given recent surgery; but contrasted CT abd/pelv did not show colitis (ischemic or otherwise) and intra op MAP = 80s w/o acute BP drops, but he was hypotensive down to 90s/40s at presentation from self induced diarrhea at home (felt constipated and had lots of dairy); there was short segment of thickening of descending colon, but unlikely significant finding
- LA = 1.9, unlikely mesenteric ischemia
- but wife reported a bit of dark blood in BM prior to arrival, and nurse noted red discoloration on diaper overnight; I did not see major hemorrhoids on exam
- CT did not suggest herald bleed from aortoenteric fistula
- rectal twice had normal colored stool w/o melena or frank blood
- although the cause is yet unclear, given the timing the most likely seems to be vascular in origin; although colonscopic eval could be considered, would like to defer first since pt himself is strongly against invasive w/u at this time; secondly, the management would be the same if an area of ischemia is found, supportive care
