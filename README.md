#Health App Challenge

This is a samlpe application for
the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Health App Challenge

To test site, use the username user@example.com and the password is useruser

The site can be viewed through http://blooming-inlet-4923.herokuapp.com or localhost:3000

All of the files are saved under omrails

I was unable to finish everything, so some links do not have paths and the sample data is not present either.

To view some of the unfinshed pages, after signing in, add /data to view a page for updating your own medical history.

To view the page that was going to be the viewers homepage, add /users/1

Again, although I was unable to complete my submission, I appreciate you having the competition. This is my first coding project, so I still have a lot to learn, but I enjoyed learning more about it through this project. 

Creating this application sounds like a great initiative, and I wish you the best of luck on the final product.
